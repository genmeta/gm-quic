`gm-quic` is a QUIC transport protocol implemented with native asynchronous Rust. It offers an efficient and scalable implementation of RFC9000, and is of high engineering quality, making it extremely valuable for learning.


## Design Principles

The QUIC protocol is a rather complex, IO-intensive protocol, making it extremely fit for asynchronous programming. 
The basic events in asynchronous IO are read, write, and timers. However, throughout the implementation of the QUIC protocol, 
the internal events are intricate and dazzling. If you look at the protocol carefully, you wll found that
certain structures become evident, revealing that the core of the QUIC protocol is driven by layers of underlying IO events progressively influencing 
the application layer behavior. For example, when the data of a stream is contiguous, it constitutes an event that awakens the corresponding application 
layer to read; similarly, when the Initial data exchange completes and the Handshake keys are obtained, this is another event that awakens the task processing 
the Handshake data packet. These events illustrate the classic Reactor pattern. `gm-quic` refines and encapsulates these various internal Reactors of QUIC, 
making each module more independent, clarifying the cooperation between the system's modules, and thereby making the overall design more user-friendly.

It is noticeable that the QUIC protocol has multiple layers. In the transport layer, there are many functions such as opening new connections, 
receiving, sending, reading, writing, and accepting new connections, most of which are asynchronous. Here, we call these functions as various 
`functor`s with each layer having its own `functor`. With these layers in place, it becomes clear that the `Accept Functor` and the `Read Functor`, 
or the `Write Functor`, do not belong to the same layer, which is quite interesting.

## Code Structure 

- **qbase**: Core structure of the QUIC protocol, including variable integer encoding (VarInt), connection ID management, stream ID, various frame and packet type definitions, and asynchronous keys.
- **qrecovery**: The reliable transport part of QUIC, encompassing the state machine evolution of the sender/receiver, and the internal logic interaction between the application layer and the transport layer.
- **qcongestion**: Congestion control in QUIC, which abstracts a unified congestion control interface and implements BBRv1. In the future, it will also implement more transport control algorithms such as Cubic and others.
- **qconnection**: Encapsulation of QUIC connections, linking the necessary components and tasks within a QUIC connection to ensure smooth operation.
- **qudp**: High-performance UDP encapsulation for QUIC. Ordinary UDP incurs a system call for each packet sent or received, resulting in poor performance. 
qudp optimizes UDP performance to the extreme using techniques like GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) and GRO (Generic Receive Offload). The performance test results for sending are as follows:

## Progress Updates

`gm-quic` is not fully complete yet, but most of its basic functional modules are already usable. 
The remaining tasks involve filling gaps in qconnection and linking various modules together. 
The core team is working hard to complete this final piece of the puzzle. Stay tuned!
