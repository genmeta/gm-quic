/// Roles in the QUIC protocol, including client and server.
///
/// The least significant bit (0x01) of the [`StreamId`](crate::sid) identifies the initiator role of the stream.
/// Client-initiated streams have even-numbered stream IDs (with the bit set to 0),
/// and server-initiated streams have odd-numbered stream IDs (with the bit set to 1).
/// See [section-2.1-3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-2.1-3)
/// of [QUIC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html).
///
/// # Note
///
/// As a protocol capable of multiplexing streams, QUIC is different from traditional
/// HTTP protocols for clients and servers.
/// In the QUIC protocol, it is not only the client that can actively open a new stream;
/// the server can also actively open a new stream to push some data to the client.
/// In fact, in a new stream, the server can initiate an HTTP3 request to the client,
/// and the client, upon receiving the request, responds back to the server.
/// In this case, the client surprisingly plays the role of the traditional "server",
/// which is quite fascinating.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use qbase::role::Role;
///
/// let local = Role::Client;
/// let peer = !local;
/// let is_client = matches!(local, Role::Client); // true
/// let is_server = matches!(peer, Role::Server); // true
/// ```
